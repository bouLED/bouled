# Plate and support

`plate.slvs` is the plate that supports the main PCB, the power
distribution board and the LiPo battery. It fits inside the icosahedron,
"sandwiched" between its supports (`support.slvs`), which are screwed to the
PCBs.

The plate is meant to be glued to its supports using epoxy.
